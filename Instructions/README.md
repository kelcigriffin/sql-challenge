### Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `sql-challenge`. **Do not add this assignment to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as `EmployeeSQL`.

4. Note that you’ll add your files to this folder and push the changes to GitHub.

### Files

Download the following files to help you get started:

### Instructions

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

    * Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

    * For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a [composite key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key), which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

    * Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

    > **Hint** To avoid errors, import the data in the same order as the corresponding tables got created. And, remember to account for the headers when doing the imports.

#### Data Analysis

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

### Requirements

### Grading

This assignment will be evaluated against the requirements and assigned a grade according to the following table:

| Grade | Points |
| --- | --- |
| A (+/-) | 90+ |
| B (+/-) | 80&ndash;89 |
| C (+/-) | 70&ndash;79 |
| D (+/-) | 60&ndash;69 |
| F (+/-) | < 60 |

### Submission

Before submitting your Challenge assignment, make sure that you’ve done the following:

* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a `.sql` file of your table schemata.

* Create a `.sql` file of your queries.

* Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough `README.md` file

To submit your Challenge assignment, click Submit, and then provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

> **Note** You are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest two grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next module.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in Bootcamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or your Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an additional review, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

> **Important:** **It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo**. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.
