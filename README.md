# Overview
This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing an employee database. The database consists of multiple tables, including departments, titles, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, and salaries. The queries aim to provide insights into employee-related information.

# Table Creation
The database schema is defined through the creation of tables. The tables include departments, titles, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, and salaries. Foreign key relationships are established between these tables to maintain data integrity.

# SQL Queries
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3.List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
